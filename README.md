Boiler plate for p5.play


Instructions-
THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH BUT FUN ONE!!!!
In this project we will be creating one of the most played games called snake.
In this game the user is a square/snake on the screen. He/She can move around
the screen using the “Arrow Keys”.
The snake eats the red dot/bug. Every time the snake eats a bug he/she increases
in length by one square. The snake can eat as many bugs as he/she wants.
Each bug eaten increases the players score by 1.

If the snake touches the corner of the screen, he/she dies. Also if the snake
touches itself he/she dies.
You can create this project by making an array that stores a new square everytime
the snake eats a square.
Here’s a video of a snake game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkzWZyCju_U
